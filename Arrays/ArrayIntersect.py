#Problem
# Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2,  return an array of their intersection. 
# Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

#Atempt 1: Brute force O(NÂ²)

                nums2.remove(number)
                break
    return intersection

# Atempt 2: dictionaries

    ocurrence    = {}
    intersection = []
    #Build a dictionary such as {num: count}
